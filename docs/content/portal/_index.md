## Overview

The Azure landing zone portal accelerator provides a user-friendly interface for deploying the Azure landing zone platform. It is designed to help customers get up and running quickly, and to evaluate the platform. The portal accelerator is a great option for customers who are new to Azure landing zones, or who want to deploy the platform quickly without having to learn infrastructure as code (IaC) and DevOps best practices. The portal accelerator is not intended to be used for production deployments, and does not include all of the features and capabilities of the IaC options. However, it is a great way to get started with Azure landing zones and to evaluate the platform.
