## Breaking changes

While we try very hard to avoid breaking changes, there are times when a feature request, product launch, or Cloud Adoption Framework guidance necessitates us updating the accelerator in a way that may require updates to configuration while updating your code base.

## Release Notes

### [ALZ PowerShell Module - v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-PowerShell-Module/releases/tag/v7.0.0) and [Accelerator Bootstrap Modules - v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/accelerator-bootstrap-modules/releases/tag/v7.0.0)

- Release date: 2026-01-30
- Release link: [ALZ PowerShell Module - v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-PowerShell-Module/releases/tag/v7.0.0) and [Accelerator Bootstrap Modules - v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/accelerator-bootstrap-modules/releases/tag/v7.0.0)
- Release diff: [ALZ PowerShell Module - v6.0.5...v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-PowerShell-Module/compare/v6.0.5...v7.0.0) and [Accelerator Bootstrap Modules - v6.1.8...v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/accelerator-bootstrap-modules/compare/v6.1.8...v7.0.0)

This release is focussed on simplifying and improving the security posture of the ALZ IaC Accelerator. We have reduced the scope of role assignments and removed the need for custom role definitions where possible.

- The read / write role assignments for the User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) now use the built-in `Owner` and `Reader` roles at the.
- The role assignments are now just applied at the management group, they are no longer applied to each platform subscription.
- The Bicep read identity still requires a custom role definition for `action` permissions, but it is much simplified and just requires `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/whatIf/action` and `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/validate/action`.
- The role assignments are now just applied at the intermediate root management group, they are no longer applied at the parent management group.

In order to achieve this, we had to move the responsibility for creating the intermediate root management group to the bootstrap modules. The name and display name are determined from the relevant configuration files, so there are no additional inputs required.

We have also introduced a new convenience function that the accelerator now moves the platform subscriptions under the intermediate root management group automatically. This removes the need for users to manually move the subscriptions prior to deploying the platform landing zone. We have also catered for this on destroy for Terraform, it will move them back to intermediate root and then the default management group when destroying the accelerator.

There have been other quality of life improvements in this release, including:

- New cmdlets for destroying Azure DevOps and GitHub resources created by the accelerator. `Remove-AzureDevOpsAccelerator` and `Remove-GitHubAccelerator`.
- Improved and standardized logging throughout the PowerShell module.

### [ALZ PowerShell Module - v6.0.4](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-PowerShell-Module/releases/tag/v6.0.4)

- Release date: 2026-01-10
- Release link: [v6.0.4](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-PowerShell-Module/releases/tag/v6.0.4)
- Release diff: [v5.1.7...v6.0.4](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-PowerShell-Module/compare/v5.1.7...v6.0.4)

We released a new interactive experience for the ALZ PowerShell Module in v6.0.0 to simplify the process of generating bootstrap configuration files for the ALZ Terraform and Bicep Starter Modules.

Now when you run the `Deploy-Accelerator` command without any parameters, you will be guided through a series of prompts to gather the necessary information to generate your bootstrap configuration files.

Features include:

- Interactive prompts for key configuration options
- Validation of user input to ensure correctness
- Lookup of existing Azure resources to simplify configuration
- Generation of bootstrap configuration files for both Terraform and Bicep Starter Modules

The documentation has been updated to reflect the new interactive experience. You can find the updated guide [here]({{< relref "accelerator/2_bootstrap" >}}).

**Azure Verified Modules Bicep (`iac_type: bicep`)**:

- Introduces support for [alz-bicep-accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/alz-bicep-accelerator) built on Azure Verified Modules
- Provides enhanced modularity and maintainability
- Recommended for new Azure Landing Zone deployments

**Classic Bicep (`iac_type: bicep-classic`)**:

- Continues support for 1 year for the traditional [ALZ-Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/ALZ-Bicep) framework
- Maintains backward compatibility for existing deployments
- No changes required for current Bicep users
- Will be removed as an accelerator option within 3 months of this release

**User Impact**: Existing users can continue using their current configurations without changes. New users can choose the framework that best fits their needs.

### [Terraform Starter Module - v13.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v13.0.0)

- Release date: 2025-11-21
- Release link: [v13.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v13.0.0)
- Release diff: [v12.1.0...v13.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/compare/v12.1.0...v13.0.0)

#### Breaking Changes

The private link private DNS resolver pattern module went through a significant refactor to improve the user experience and provide better support for advanced scenarios. This resulted in some breaking changes to the interface.

There is also impact on Terraform state. Where possible we have included `moved` blocks to automatically migrate state. However, in some scenarios where customization outside of the standard accelerator examples has been done, you may need to add your own `moved` blocks to ensure state is migrated correctly.

You will know you need to do this if your Terraform plan indicates that resources will be destroyed and recreated. Please review the plan carefully before applying.

If you are in that scenario, then we have provided a way to generate the necessary `moved` blocks.

We have added a temporary output called `private_link_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link_moved_blocks` that will output the necessary `moved` blocks for your configuration. However it is turned off by default to avoid noise in the output.

Follow these steps to generate the `moved` blocks and add them to your configuration:

1. Follow your normal process, to clone the repo and create a branch
1. In your `platform_landing_zone.auto.tfvars`, scroll to the very bottom and uncomment the following line:

    ```terraform
    # private_link_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link_moved_blocks_enabled = true
    ```

1. Commit and push your changes to your branch
1. Create a pull request to your main branch, but do not merge it yet
1. Wait for the CI pipeline to run and navigate to the plan stage and step
1. Look for the output called `private_link_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link_moved_blocks` and copy all the moved blocks from that variable.
1. Create a new file called `moved.tf` in the root of your repo and paste the moved blocks into that file.
1. Run `terraform fmt` to format the file correctly.
1. Commit and push the new `moved.tf` file to your branch.
1. Now wait for the CI pipeline to run again. This time when you examine the plan you should not see any unexpected resource destruction and recreation.
1. Once you are satisfied with the plan, you can merge your pull request and trigger the CD pipeline as normal.

#### New Features

This release introduces support for private link private DNS zone resolution policy to forward to internet if not resolved. This setting is off by default to maintain backwards compatibility.

Example configuration to set forwarding policy using the `virtual_network_link_overrides_by_zone` for two zones on all virtual network links:

```terraform
private_dns_zones = {
  parent_id = "$${dns_resource_group_id}"
  virtual_network_link_overrides_by_zone = {
    azure_storage_blob = {
      resolution_policy = "NxDomainRedirect"
    }
    azure_api_management = {
      resolution_policy = "NxDomainRedirect"
    }
  }
  private_link_private_dns_zones_regex_filter = {
    enabled = false
  }
  auto_registration_zone_enabled = "$${primary_private_dns_auto_registration_zone_enabled}"
  auto_registration_zone_name    = "$${primary_auto_registration_zone_name}"
}
```

### [Terraform Starter Module - v12.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v12.0.0)

- Release date: 2025-11-03
- Release link: [v12.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v12.0.0)
- Release diff: [v11.0.0...v12.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/compare/v11.0.0...v12.0.0)

This release introduces explicit variable definitions for the majority on configuration options. This is to improve the user experience. This will provide better auto-completion and avoid issues with multi-region connectivity and complex configurations.

There is no impact on state and upgrading the module will not result in any changes or destruction of existing resources. All planned changes are to migrate state or for updated versions of connectivity modules.

There have been significant change to the variable interface. We have updated the example configuration files to reflect the changes. The best way to see the changes is to diff v11.0.0 with v12.0.0 for your scenario. Changes include:

- Flattening of hub and spoke network variables, moving some from nested objects to top level variables.
- Removal of region specific replacements, these are now automatically handled by the connectivity modules. Zones can still be overridden if desired.
- Migration of Virtual WAN configuration to dedicated variable objects.

We don't plan any further significant changes to the module interface for the foreseeable future. Any further changes will be additive and non-breaking.

### [Terraform Starter Module - v9.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v9.0.0)

- Release date: 2025-09-12
- Release link: [v9.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v9.0.0)
- Release diff: [v8.1.1...v9.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/compare/v8.1.1...v9.0.0)

This release introduces the Security management group and platform subscription. It also includes the H2 FY25 policy refresh.

Read more about the Security management group in this [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuregovernanceandmanagementblog/a-new-platform-management-group--subscription-for-security-in-azure-landing-zone/4433287).

Read more about the H2 FY25 policy refresh [here](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/Whats-new#-policy-refresh-h2-fy25).

The Security management group is on by default. In order to not deploy the Security management group, you need to:

- Remove it from the [architecture definition file](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/blob/main/templates/platform_landing_zone/lib/architecture_definitions/alz_custom.alz_architecture_definition.yaml)
- Remove it from the [subscription placements in the Platform landing zone configuration file](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/blob/b4115bfe9e6606a06def329f9e0574bc80747c83/templates/platform_landing_zone/examples/full-multi-region/hub-and-spoke-vnet.tfvars#L226)
- Remove the security subscription line from the bootstrap configuration file if using the accelerator for a new deployment

### [Terraform Starter Module - v8.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v8.0.0)

- Release date: 2025-06-20
- Release link: [v8.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v8.0.0)
- Release diff: [v7.4.0...v8.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/compare/v7.4.0...v8.0.0)

This release introduces various fixes, all of which are backwards compatible.

There is one change that requires action by users, which is why we decided to flag this as a major release as we wanted to highlight this change.

ExpressRoute Gateway is rolling out a new feature called HOBO (hosted on behalf of) public ip. This feature means that the ExpressRoute Gateway will use a public IP address that is hosted on behalf of the customer, rather than requiring the customer to provide their own public IP address. At this time, there is no way for us to know which regions and subscriptions the feature has been rolled out to. As such we have introduce a new setting called `<region>_virtual_network_gateway_express_route_hobo_public_ip_enabled`. This setting is `true` by default as we believe this will suit most customers moving forward as this feature rolls out.

For existing customers, they will need to set this to `false` unless they have followed the manual migration process to upgrade their ExpressRoute Gateway to use the HOBO public IP. If a customer does not set this to `false`, they will likely see errors and idempotency issues.

For new customers in a region where the feature rolled out, they will need to ensure the setting is `true`. If they do not, they will see idempotency issues and errors when deploying / updating the ExpressRoute Gateway.

The product group has not yet announced this feature, but it has already started rolling out to customers and is impacting Terraform customers in particular. Versions of this module prior to v8.0.0 were unable to support the HOBO public IP feature as it is not supported by the azurerm provider. In this release we have migrated virtual network gateways to azapi in order to support this feature.

### [Terraform Starter Module - v7.4.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v7.4.0)

- Release date: 2025-06-13
- Release link: [v7.4.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v7.4.0)
- Release diff: [v7.3.2...v7.4.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/compare/v7.3.2...v7.4.0)

This release introduces the Azure Firewall Management IP and Associated subnet by default per our Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) guidance. This will be on by default for new customers. However, this would be a breaking change for existing users, since it is not possible to add a management IP to an existing Azure Firewall at this time. The setting would result in a plan to destroy and recreate the Azure Firewall, which may want to be planned for a future maintenance window.

In order to support backwards compatibility we have introduced the `<region>-firewall_management_ip_enabled` setting in the configuration file. This setting is `true` by default, but can be set to `false` to avoid the management IP being created and avoid the Azure Firewall being destroyed and recreated.

### [Terraform Starter Module - v7.3.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v7.3.0)

- Release date: 2025-06-09
- Release link: [v7.3.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v7.3.0)
- Release diff: [v7.2.0...v7.3.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/compare/v7.2.0...v7.3.0)

This release introduces a default `lib` folder with predefined override and architecture files. This was introduced to improve the [Options]({{< relref "accelerator/startermodules/terraform-platform-landing-zone/options" >}}) that involve the need to turn of policies, such as AMA, DNS, and DDOS. Previously these options advised setting the policy to `DoNotEnforce`, however we found that in some cases that still result in failed deployments of spokes, due to the policy faulting even though it wasn't enforced. As such, that safest approach it to not assign the policy at all. We introduced the default `lib` archetype overrides to simplify this process for those not familiar with the modules.

- We introduced a new step to the accelerator to always setup a `lib` folder. This can be found in Phase 2 of the [User Guide]({{< relref "accelerator/2_bootstrap" >}}) for all three VCS options.
- Updated the [Options]({{< relref "accelerator/startermodules/terraform-platform-landing-zone/options" >}}) to reference this `lib` folder and explain what needs to be uncommented in the archetype overrides:
    - [Customize Management Group Ids and Names]({{< relref "accelerator/startermodules/terraform-platform-landing-zone/options/management-groups" >}})
    - [Turn off DDoS Protection Plan]({{< relref "accelerator/startermodules/terraform-platform-landing-zone/options/ddos" >}})
    - [Turn off Private DNS zones]({{< relref "accelerator/startermodules/terraform-platform-landing-zone/options/dns" >}})
    - [Turn off a Policy Assignment]({{< relref "accelerator/startermodules/terraform-platform-landing-zone/options/policy-assignment" >}})
    - [Turn off Azure Monitoring Agent]({{< relref "accelerator/startermodules/terraform-platform-landing-zone/options/ama" >}})

In order to achieve this, we introduced a custom architecture to follow best practice for the Library setup. Previously we advised overriding the `alz` architecture for simplicity.

We also updated the default files to use YAML versions, in order make updating them a consistent approach for new accelerator users.

As a result of this, any customers with an existing `lib` folder customization attempting a diff upgrade will see additional files in lib and the new `architecture_name` setting in the config file. In order to avoid any issues, exclude these files and the `architecture_name` setting when upgrading.

If you do want to bring your `lib` folder into line with the YAML standard, you can migrate your customizations into the YAML template format and delete the old JSON file.

### [Terraform Starter Module - v7.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v7.2.0)

- Release date: 2025-05-06
- Release link: [v7.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v7.2.0)
- Release diff: [v7.1.0...v7.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/compare/v7.1.0...v7.2.0)

This release fixes an issue where Virtual WAN network connections were not being created for the sidecar virtual network when private DNS zones were disabled. As part of the fix the default name for these links had to be updated to match the actual use case. This will result in a plan that attempts to destroy and recreate the virtual network connections. In order to avoid this we introduced a setting called `virtual_network_connection_name` to allow overriding the name the retain the legacy name and avoid them being recreated. We have include this as a commented out setting in the configuration files for ease of use.

In order to use the legacy name, uncomment the `virtual_network_connection_name` setting in configuration file when performing your diff.

### [Terraform Starter Module - v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v7.0.0)

- Release date: 2025-06-02
- Release link: [v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/releases/tag/v7.0.0)
- Release diff: [v6.2.2...v7.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/compare/v6.2.2...v7.0.0)

This release introduces a new interface for DNS configuration. The new interface allows independent configuration of private DNS zones and private DNS resolver, including turning them on and of independently. In order to achieve this, we had to move the private DNS resolver outside of the private DNS Zones block. We also introduced the capability to supply any configuration variable to both of the underlying modules to ensure flexibility moving forward.

This resulted in the following change the example configuration files, which you will need to update to use the new version of the code:

Old:

```terraform
private_dns_zones = {
  enabled                        = "$${primary_private_dns_zones_enabled}"
  resource_group_name            = "$${dns_resource_group_name}"
  is_primary                     = true
  auto_registration_zone_enabled = "$${primary_private_dns_auto_registration_zone_enabled}"
  auto_registration_zone_name    = "$${primary_auto_registration_zone_name}.azure.local"
  subnet_address_prefix          = "$${primary_private_dns_resolver_subnet_address_prefix}"
  private_dns_resolver = {
    enabled = "$${primary_private_dns_resolver_enabled}"
    name    = "$${primary_private_dns_resolver_name}"
  }
}
```

New:

```terraform
private_dns_zones = {
  enabled = "$${primary_private_dns_zones_enabled}"
  dns_zones = {
    resource_group_name = "$${dns_resource_group_name}"
    private_link_private_dns_zones_regex_filter = {
      enabled = false
    }
  }
  auto_registration_zone_enabled = "$${primary_private_dns_auto_registration_zone_enabled}"
  auto_registration_zone_name    = "$${primary_auto_registration_zone_name}"
}
private_dns_resolver = {
  enabled               = "$${primary_private_dns_resolver_enabled}"
  subnet_address_prefix = "$${primary_private_dns_resolver_subnet_address_prefix}"
  dns_resolver = {
    name = "$${primary_private_dns_resolver_name}"
  }
}
```
