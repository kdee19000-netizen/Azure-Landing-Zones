title: 8 - Single-Region Hub and Spoke Virtual Network with Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)
weight: 8
---

A full Platform landing zone deployment with hub and spoke Virtual Network connectivity in a single region, ready for a third party Network Virtual Appliance (NVA).

{{< hint type=warning >}}
The single region option is here for completeness, we recommend always having at least 2 regions to support resiliency.

### Connectivity

#### Azure DDOS Protection Plan

- DDOS Protection Plan

#### Azure Virtual Networks

- Hub virtual networks in one region
- Subnets for Network Virtual Appliance, Gateway, Bastion, and Private DNS Resolver in one region
- Azure Route table for Network Virtual Appliance in one region
- Azure Route table for other subnets and spokes in one region

#### Azure Bastion

- Azure Bastion in one region
- Azure Bastion public ip in one region

#### Azure Private DNS

- Azure Private DNS Resolver in one region
- Azure non-regional Private Link Private DNS zones in one region

- Azure VPN Virtual Network Gateway in one region

## Configuration

The following relevant configuration is applied:

### Azure DNS

Private DNS is configured ready for using Private Link and Virtual Machine Auto-registration. Spoke Virtual Networks should use the Network Virtual Appliance IP Address in the same region as their DNS configuration.

- Network Virtual Appliance should be configured as DNS proxy
- Network Virtual Appliance should be forward DNS traffic to the Private DNS resolver
- Azure Private DNS Resolver has an inbound endpoint from the hub network
- Azure Private Link DNS zones are linked to the all hub Virtual Networks

### Azure Routing

Route tables are pre-configured for spoke virtual networks in each region. Assign the user subnet route table to any subnets created in spokes.

- Network Virtual Appliance in relevant region as next hop in Route Table
