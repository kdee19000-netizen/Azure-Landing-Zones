- DDOS Protection Plan

#### Azure Virtual Networks

- Hub virtual networks in each region
- Hub virtual network peering
- Subnets for Firewall, Gateway, Bastion, and Private DNS Resolver in each region
- Azure Route table for Firewall per region
- Azure Route table for other subnets and spokes per region

#### Azure Firewall

- Azure Firewall per region
- Azure Firewall public IP per region
- Azure Firewall policy per region

#### Azure Bastion

- Azure Bastion per region
- Azure Bastion public IP per region

#### Azure Private DNS

- Azure Private DNS Resolver per region
- Azure non-regional Private Link Private DNS zones in primary region
- Azure regional Private Link Private DNS zones per region
- Azure Virtual Machine auto-registration Private DNS zone per region
- Azure Private Link DNS zone virtual network links per region

#### Azure Virtual Network Gateways

- Azure ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway per region
- Azure VPN Virtual Network Gateway per region

## Configuration

The following relevant configuration is applied:

### Azure DNS

Private DNS is configured ready for using Private Link and Virtual Machine Auto-registration. Spoke Virtual Networks should use the Azure Firewall IP Address in the same region as their DNS configuration.

- Azure Firewall is configured as DNS proxy
- Azure Firewall forwards DNS traffic to the Private DNS resolver
- Azure Private DNS Resolver has an inbound endpoint from the hub network
- Azure Private Link DNS zones are linked to all the hub Virtual Networks

### Azure Routing

Route tables are pre-configured for spoke virtual networks in each region. Assign the user subnet route table to any subnets created in spokes.

- Azure Firewall in relevant region as next hop in Route Table
