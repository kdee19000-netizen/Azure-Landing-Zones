title: 6 - Single-Region Hub and Spoke Virtual Network with Azure Firewall
weight: 6
---

A full Platform landing zone deployment with hub and spoke Virtual Network connectivity using Azure Firewall in a single region.

{{< hint type=warning >}}
The single region option is here for completeness, we recommend always having at least 2 regions to support resiliency.

#### Azure Virtual Networks

- Hub virtual network in one region
- Subnets for Firewall, Gateway, Bastion, and Private DNS Resolver in one region
- Azure Route table for Firewall in one region
- Azure Route table for other subnets and spokes in one region

#### Azure Firewall

- Azure Firewall in one region
- Azure Firewall public IP in one region
- Azure Firewall policy in one region

#### Azure Bastion

- Azure Bastion in one region
- Azure Bastion public ip in one region

#### Azure Private DNS

- Azure Private DNS Resolver in one region
- Azure non-regional Private Link Private DNS zones in one region

- Azure VPN Virtual Network Gateway in one region

## Configuration

The following relevant configuration is applied:

### Azure DNS

Private DNS is configured ready for using Private Link and Virtual Machine Auto-registration. Spoke Virtual Networks should use the Azure Firewall IP Address as their DNS configuration.

- Azure Firewall is configured as DNS proxy
- Azure Firewall forwards DNS traffic to the Private DNS resolver
- Azure Private DNS Resolver has an inbound endpoint from the hub network
- Azure Private Link DNS zones are linked to the all hub Virtual Networks

### Azure Routing

Route tables are pre-configured for spoke virtual networks in one region. Assign the user subnet route table to any subnets created in spokes.

- Azure Firewall in one region as next hop in Route Table
