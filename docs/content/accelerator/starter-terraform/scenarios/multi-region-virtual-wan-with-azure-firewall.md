## Configuration

The following relevant configuration is applied:

### Azure DNS

Private DNS is configured ready for using Private Link and Virtual Machine Auto-registration. Spoke Virtual Networks should use the Azure Firewall IP Address in the same region as their DNS configuration.

- Azure Firewall is configured as DNS proxy
- Azure Firewall forwards DNS traffic to the Private DNS resolver
- Azure Private DNS Resolver has an inbound endpoint from the sidecar network
- Azure Private Link DNS zones are linked to all hub sidecar Virtual Networks
