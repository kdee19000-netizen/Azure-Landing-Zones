{{< hint type=important >}}
We plan to expand this option to contain more detailed steps specific to the accelerator in future releases.
{{< /hint >}}

The [avm-ptn-alz](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-alz/azurerm/latest) Terraform module used by the accelerator fully supports creating and managing custom policies, policy initiatives, and policy assignments through your custom library.

To create and assign custom policies, follow the guidance in the [Custom Policies]({{< relref "terraform/custom-policy" >}}) section of the documentation.
