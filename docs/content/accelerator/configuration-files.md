Three configuration inputs are available:

* [Bootstrap Configuration File](#bootstrap-configuration-file)
* [Platform landing zone Configuration File](#platform-landing-zone-configuration-file)
* [Platform landing zone Library (lib) Folder](#platform-landing-zone-library-lib-folder)

{{< hint type=tip title="JSON instead of YAML">}}
If you are unable to install the [`powershell-yaml` module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/powershell-yaml) (the ALZ module tries to install this automatically for you when invoked), you **can** use `.json` files instead.

We would advise you complete the customizations in YAML and then convert to JSON if necessary as a final step prior to running the `Deploy-Accelerator` function.

You will need to convert your YAML files to JSON before running the bootstrap script. You can use an online YAML to JSON converter or a tool like [DevToys](https://devtoys.app/).

### Bootstrap Configuration File


YAML file containing configuration for bootstrapping your VCS and Azure. Examples are provided for each IaC and VCS combination.

{{< hint type=note >}}
Some of this configuration is also fed into the starter module to avoid duplication of inputs. This includes management group ID, subscriptions IDs, starter locations, etc. You will see a `terraform.tfvars.json` file is created in your repository after the bootstrap has run for this purpose.

### Platform landing zone Configuration File

#### Terraform

{{< hint type=note >}}
Only required for Terraform ALZ starter module. Bicep users can skip this.
{{< /hint >}}

HCL `tfvars` file determining deployed resources and hub networking type. Copied to your repository as `*.auto.tfvars`.

Examples: [Scenarios]({{< relref "starter-terraform/scenarios">}})

#### Bicep

This is the `yaml` file that determines resource names and other configuration for the Bicep Azure Verified Modules for Platform landing zone (ALZ) starter module.

### Platform landing zone Library (lib) Folder

{{< hint type=note >}}
Only required for Terraform ALZ starter module. Bicep users can skip this.
{{< /hint >}}

Configuration files for customizing management groups and policies. By default, an empty `lib` folder is provided.

Use cases:
* Renaming or restructuring management groups
* Modifying policy assignments
* Adding custom policy definitions
