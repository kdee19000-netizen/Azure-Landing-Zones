Set up the prerequisites by following the steps below.

## 1 - Tools and Internet Access

Install the following tools before getting started.

* PowerShell 7.4 (or newer): [Follow the instructions for your operating system](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
* Azure CLI 2.55.0 (or newer): [Follow the instructions for your operating system](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* Git (any supported version): [Follow the instructions for your operating system](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* VSCode (not required, highly recommended): [Follow the instructions for your operating system](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

{{< hint type=note >}}
Ensure all tools are available from a PowerShell Core (pwsh) terminal. Add them to your environment path if needed.
{{< /hint >}}

You also need internet access to download tools, Terraform providers, and connect to Azure and your VCS.

We **DO NOT** explicitly support:

* Running behind a corporate proxy
* Running in Azure Cloud Shell

{{< hint type=tip >}}
If your local machine is behind a corporate proxy, consider spinning up a temporary VM in Azure to run the Accelerator from, then tear it down when you are done. Alternatively, turn the VM off and retain it for future use/upgrades or tear down of the environment.
