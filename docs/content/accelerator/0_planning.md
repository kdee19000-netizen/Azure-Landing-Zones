Plan your deployment by following the steps below.

{{< hint type=note >}}
This phase is optional. You can skip it and go straight to [Phase 1]({{< relref "1_prerequisites" >}}) if you already know what you want to deploy.
{{< /hint >}}

## 1 - Learn

Learn about the Azure landing zone architecture and the accelerator.

### Glossary

You should understand these terms before you start:

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual configuration.
* Platform landing zone: See [Azure landing zone documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/).
* Bootstrap or Bootstrap Module: The IaC module that sets up version control, CI/CD pipelines, and required Azure resources before deploying the Platform landing zone.
* Starter or Starter Module: A pre-configured IaC module for deploying Platform landing zone configurations.
* Accelerator PowerShell Module: The PowerShell module that is used to deploy the bootstrap. Find it here: [https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ALZ](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ALZ).

### Technical Knowledge

You should have a good understanding of the following technologies and concepts:

* Terraform Workflow: Understand the standard write, init, plan and apply workflow. [Learning path](https://aka.ms/tf/fundamentals)
* Terraform HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language): Understand the basics of HCL. [Learning path](https://aka.ms/tf/labs)
* DevOps: Understand the fundamentals of DevOps. [Learning path](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-to-devops/)
* Continuous Integration and Delivery: Understand the basics of CI/CD. [Learning path](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/explain-devops-continous-delivery-quality/)
* git version control: Understand the fundamentals of git. [Learning path](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/intro-to-git/)

## 2 - Download the checklist

We provide a spreadsheet that you can use to help gather the required information to make choices and fill out configuration files. You can download it {{< a-download href="examples/tf/accelerator/config/checklist.xlsx" download="checklist.xlsx" >}}HERE{{< /a-download >}}.

This file has several tabs, described here:

* Accelerator - Bootstrap: This tab details the settings required for the bootstrap configuration
* Accelerator - Bicep: This tab details the settings required for the Bicep configuration
* Accelerator - Terraform: This tab details the settings required for the Azure Verified Modules for Platform landing zone (ALZ) configuration

{{< hint type=tip >}}
As an advanced user, you can go right ahead and fill in the configuration file directly, you don't have to use the spreadsheet.
{{< /hint >}}

After following this set of decisions, you will have a completed `checklist.xlsx` file that you can use in phases 1 and 2.

There are two sets of decisions to make, one for the bootstrap and one for the Platform landing zone.

* [Bootstrap Decisions](#3---bootstrap-decisions)
* [Platform landing zone (Starter) Decisions](#4---platform-landing-zone-starter-decisions)

## 3 - Bootstrap Decisions

The following decisions need to be made before you start the bootstrap process.

Fill out the `Accelerator - Bootstrap` tab of the `checklist.xlsx` file with the relevant settings for the bootstrap configuration by following these steps below:

{{< hint type=tip >}}
Each decision number maps to a decision number in the `checklist.xlsx` file.
{{< /hint >}}

### Decision 1 - Choose Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tooling

The accelerator supports both Bicep and Terraform. You need to choose one of these to use for the bootstrap process.

Fill out the `Infrastructure as Code` value with either `bicep` or `terraform`.

### Decision 2 - Choose a version control system

We support Azure DevOps and GitHub. For other version control systems, use the local file system option and implement your own CI/CD pipeline.

Choose either:

* Azure DevOps: Choose this option if you are using Azure DevOps.
* GitHub: Choose this option if you are using GitHub.
* Local: Choose this option if you are using another version control system, such as GitLab or Bitbucket.

Fill out the `Version control system` value with either `alz_azuredevops`, `alz_github`, or `alz_local`.

### Decision 3 - Choose a starter module

Below is a table describing the available starter modules, along with guidance on their use:

| Starter Module | Setting | Description | Recommendation |
|--|--|----|---|
| [Bicep - Platform landing zone]({{< relref "starter-bicep">}}) | `platform_landing_zone` | Multi-region implementation using Azure Verified Modules for networking that accepts a configuration file to customize. Uses the alz-bicep-accelerator framework. | Use this for new Bicep deployments (iac_type: `bicep`) |
| [Terraform - Azure Verified Modules for Platform landing zone (ALZ)]({{< relref "starter-terraform">}}) | `platform_landing_zone` | Multi-region implementation using Azure Verified Modules for networking that accepts a configuration file to customize. | Use this for Terraform deployments |

Fill out the `Starter module` value with either `platform_landing_zone` or `complete`.

### Decision 4 - Choose a region for the bootstrap resources

The bootstrap resources are deployed to a single region. Choose the Azure region where you would like to deploy them.

The bootstrap resources include:

* Resource groups
* Storage account for state (Terraform only)
* User assigned managed identities
* Role definitions and assignments (non-regional)

Fill out the `Bootstrap region` value with the Azure region you have chosen.

### Decision 5 - Choose region(s) for the Platform landing zone resources

Choose the Azure region(s) for Platform landing zone resources based on your data sovereignty or latency requirements.

Fill out the `Platform landing zone region(s)` value with the Azure region(s) you have chosen.

{{< hint type=note >}}
The `starter_locations` setting is in the platform landing zone configuration file for `bicep` and `terraform` iac_type, not the bootstrap configuration file.
{{< /hint >}}

### Decision 6 - Choose a parent management group

The parent management group will contain the management groups created by the bootstrap and must already exist.

The Platform landing zone hierarchy is built underneath it, with only permission applied at that scope (no policies are applied at that scope).

Fill out the `Parent management group id` value with the management group you have chosen.

### Decision 7 - Choose the platform subscriptions

We require 4 platform subscriptions: Management, Connectivity, Identity, and Security.

You may wish to follow the steps in the [phase 1 prerequisites]({{< relref "1_prerequisites/platform-subscriptions">}}) to create the 4 platform subscriptions and add the subscription IDs to the checklist now.

Fill out the `Management subscription id`, `Connectivity subscription id`, `Identity subscription id`, and `Security subscription id` values with the subscription IDs you have chosen.

### Decision 8 - Choose the bootstrap subscription

You can use a 4 or 5 subscription model. For 5 subscriptions (separate bootstrap subscription), see [advanced scenarios]({{< relref "advancedscenarios">}}).

We recommend using the Management subscription for bootstrap resources. Set `bootstrap_subscription_id` in the config file or connect via az cli.

Fill out the `Bootstrap subscription id` value with the subscription ID you have chosen.

### Decision 9 - Choose the bootstrap resource naming

Choose a `service name` and `environment name` to derive bootstrap resource names.

{{< hint type=tip >}}
To override the naming convention, see the [FAQ]({{< relref "faq">}}).
{{< /hint >}}

Fill out the `Service name` and `Environment name` values with the names you have chosen.

### Decision 10 - Choose the bootstrap networking

We offer 3 agent / runner and networking options for the bootstrap. The options and related settings are listed here:

* Private networking with self-hosted agents / runners
  * Azure DevOps:
    * `use_private_networking` = `true`
    * `use_self_hosted_agents` = `true`
  * GitHub:
    * `use_private_networking` = `true`
    * `use_self_hosted_runners` = `true`
* Public networking with self-hosted agents / runners
  * Azure DevOps:
    * `use_private_networking` = `false`
    * `use_self_hosted_agents` = `true`
  * GitHub:
    * `use_private_networking` = `false`
    * `use_self_hosted_runners` = `true`
* Public networking with Microsoft-hosted agents / runners
  * Azure DevOps:
    * `use_private_networking` = `false`
    * `use_self_hosted_agents` = `false`
  * GitHub:
    * `use_private_networking` = `false`
    * `use_self_hosted_runners` = `false`

{{< hint type=note >}}
Self-hosted agents / runners are required for private networking, so that setting will be ignored if private networking is selected.
{{< /hint >}}

Fill out the `Use private networking`, `Use self-hosted agents`, and / or `Use self-hosted runners` values with the settings you have chosen.

### Decision 11 - Choose / validate your version control system specific settings

Review the remaining settings in the `Accelerator - Bootstrap` tab of the `checklist.xlsx` file and fill out any remaining settings relevant to the chosen version control system.

You may wish to follow the steps for [phase 1 pre-requisites Azure DevOps]({{< relref "1_prerequisites/azuredevops">}}) or [phase 1 pre-requisites GitHub]({{< relref "1_prerequisites/github">}}) to create the personal access tokens (PAT) and add the PAT to the checklist.
